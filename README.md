## How to create a new map
* Maps are created with tiles
* For creating a map a level editor is highly recommended
* A free level editor is [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/)
* Create a new map

| :zap:        Change the "tile size" to 16x16 and the "map size" to Width=50tiles and Height=38tiles   |
|-----------------------------------------|

* Open a new tileset from [images\maps\customSpriteSheet.png](https://github.com/Salman-F/Parking-2D/blob/main/images/maps/customSpriteSheet.png) in your level editor
* Create a map with the given 16x16 tiles
* Please note that all black, green and grey blocks are going to be obstacles in the game

| :exclamation:         Your map must include one (just one) brown tile that represents the top left corner of your goal   |
|-----------------------------------------|

* How Big the goal is going to be should be saved in a variable with the numbers of tiles in x and y direction (default is x:6, y:12)
* Your created map with JUST the blocks from [images\maps\customSpriteSheet.png](https://github.com/Salman-F/Parking-2D/blob/main/images/maps/customSpriteSheet.png) should then look something like this.

</p>

* Export this file as csv and the obstacles are done. Now you can start designing your layout
* Copy your level and add assets, pictures or text on your level
* Export your copy as an image and the surface the user is going to see is done.
* Your map is now ready to be included into the game and could look something like this.

</p>

* Files that you need at the end
1. A csv that includes the layout of your map (created with just the tiles provided in [images\maps\customSpriteSheet.png](https://github.com/Salman-F/Parking-2D/blob/main/images/maps/customSpriteSheet.png))
2. An image that shows the design of your map

You can also start with making a design and afterwards filling it with the tiles provided in [images\maps\customSpriteSheet.png](https://github.com/Salman-F/Parking-2D/blob/main/images/maps/customSpriteSheet.png))
